  <p><font size="3">A municipal corporation is the legal term for a local governing body, including (but not necessarily 
   limited to) cities, counties, towns, townships, charter townships, villages, and boroughs. Municipal
   incorporation occurs when such municipalities become self-governing entities under the laws of the 
   state or province in which they are located. Often, this event is marked by the award or declaration of 
   a municipal charter.With the notable exception of the Citys of Corporation.</font></p> 
   <p><font size="3">In India a Municipal Corporation is a local government body that administers a city of population 200,000 or 
   more. Under the panchayati raj system, it interacts directly with the state government, though it is
   administratively part of the district it is located in.</font></p>
   <p><font size="3">The Municipal Corporation consists of members elected from the wards of the city. The Mayor and Deputy Mayor 
   are elected by the members among themselves. A Municipal Commissioner, who is from the Indian Administrative 
   Service is appointed to head the administrative staff of the Municipal Corporation, implement the decisions of 
   the Corporation and prepare its annual budget.</font></p>
   <p><font size="3">The Municipal Corporation is responsible for roads, public transportation, water supply, 
   records of births and deaths (delegated from central government Births and Deaths Registration Act), 
   sanitation that includes waste management, sewage, drainage and flood control, public safety services 
   like fire and ambulance services, gardens and maintenance of buildings. The sources of income of the 
   Corporation are property tax, entertainment tax, octroi (now abolished from many cities) and usage fees 
   for utilities.</font></p>
